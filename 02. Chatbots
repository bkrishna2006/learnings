Task based Dialog Systems / Conversational Agents & Chatbots

Task based Dialog Agents 
	-	Meant for specific tasks
	-	Short Conversations
	-	Usually limited turns (5-8)
	-	Are important as an interface to Robots
	-	Example - DoNotPay
	-	Modern dialog agents are domain Ontology based
		-	Frames (eg. Flight booking, Car booking,  and Slots (flight - origin, destination, arrival date & time, departure date & time)
	-	Architectures	
		1. GUS Architecture (Frame based); (used in Apple's Siri, Gooogle Assistant and Amazon's Alexa)
			-	Production Rule system (having capability to dynamically switch between different frames)
			-	Can have condition-action rules attached to slots (like if Destination City "slot" is filled in flight booking frame, 
				the stay location city slot in hotel booking frame can be automatically populated)
			-	Can add generic frames (like to answer questions like distance btwn two cities, which all airlines fly between 2 specific cities etc)
			-	Can add rules to answer questions from a list ("find restaurants near me")
			-	VoiceXML (industrial instantiation of the Architecture)
		2. Finite State Automaton Architecture (aka Finite State Control Architecture)

Key words - Mixed initiative or System initiative, Production Rule, Turing tests
	
Chatbots 

Chatbots are systems that can carry on extended conversations with the goal of
mimicking the unstructured conversational or ‘chats’ characteristic of human-human
interaction,

	- 	Can have multiple/unlimited turns
	-	Long/Extended Casual conversations
	-	Usually has some entertainment value.
	-	Example - Microsoft’s XiaoIce, ELIZA (Weizenbaum) used in Psychological Counseling, ALICE
	-	Applications - Travel Planning & Management, Automatic Tutoring, 
Chatbot Architectures
	
	1. Rule based
		1. Include the old ELIZA system (1966)
		2. PARRY system.
	2. Corpus based - Based on large datasets and done by (a.k.a Response Generation Systems)
		1. Information Retrieval Systems (IR based) 
			(copy a human’s response from a previous conversation)
		2. Machine translation paradigms (machine learned sequential transduction system)
			1. Neural Network sequence-to-sequence systems
			(learn to map from a user utterance to a system response)
		- Like rule-based chatbots, Corpus based Chatbots very rarely build models.
		-	Instead, Corpus based chatbots focus on generating a single response turn.
		-	Ressemble Q&A systems
	2. Information Retrieval (IR based)
		Example - Cleverbot (2017), Microsoft's XiaoIce(2014)
	3. Transductional model
	4. Frame based dialog systems
