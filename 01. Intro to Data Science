Introduction to DataScience

1.	Components of Data Science
	a.	Probability & Statistics
	b.	Linear Algebra
	c.	Computer Science
	d.	Domain knowledge
	e.	Machine Learning
2.	In data science, while solving a given business problem, an appropriate statistical computing technique may be used.
3.	These algorithms while working on the data, may either use iterative methods or linear algebra techniques for computation. 
4.	Linear Algebra works as a computational engine for most of the data science problems because of its performance advantages over iterative methods
5.	Machine Learning types
	a.	Supervised    -              Like predictions based on historical events
	b.	Unsupervised  -              Predictions with data that has no history
	c.	Semi-supervised   -          Between a and b
	d.	Reinforcement learning -     Algorithm based that seeks which trial and error action yields the best reward.
6.	Supervised M/C learning steps -
	a.	A machine is trained with known data
	b.	Machine is exposed to unknown data and is asked to infer from it.
	c.	Model is evaluated for accuracy
7.	Unsupervised M/C Learning steps – 
	a.	Fix some variables based on which the m/c will classify the data.
	b.	Machine clusters data based on known and unknown variables
	c.	Eg. Fruits with same colors (  Unsupervised learning is also known as Clustering)
8.	Semi-supervised M/C Learning steps – 
	a.	Train the model with labeled data alone
	b.	Use it to probabilistically classify the unlabeled data
	c.	Use all the data to train the model
	d.	Iterate b and c till there is convergence.

14.	To solve a given business problem, various blocks of the Data Science stack are tightly coupled with each other 
	a.	Core algorithms need to be written in some programming language for implementation.
	b.	Most algorithms use the basic concepts of linear algebra.
	c.	Statistical computations need to be done on the given data.
	d.	Available data in structured, un-structured and semi-structured form need to be managed through various data management systems.  

15.	Computer Science provides us with the necessary programming languages, database management systems, statistical analysis and machine tools.

16.	Data Science model building –In this step, we use statistics and machine learning to extract useful insights from the data in order to achieve our goals. 
The most common data science modeling tasks are as follows:
	a.	Classification: Deciding if something belongs to  one category or another
	b.	Scoring: Predicting or estimating a numeric value, such as a price or probability
	c.	Ranking: Learning to order items by preferences
	d.	Clustering: Grouping similar items based on certain parameters
	e.	Finding relations: Finding correlations or potential causes of effects seen in the data
	f.	Characterization: Very general plotting and report generation from data

18.	To execute a successful data science project, we need to make sure we have:
	a.	a clear, verifiable and quantifiable goal
	b.	set realistic expectations for all stakeholders
	c.	an unbiased data set covering examples that are sufficient to represent the entire data
	d.	the right model based on the business scenario
	e.	correctly represented and deployed the model in order to meet the pre-defined goal
